Background: You are the owner of a Fight Club and want to keep track of the fighters and fights. Who is fighting? You choose. Pokémons, dinosaurs, superheroes, characters from your favorite TV series, comics, movie, game, reality show, book - any kind of fights, wars, competitions or hunger games will do.

You should be able to:

    Add fighters.

        Each fighter should have a first name, a last name, (optional) description and an avatar.

    Add skills to each fighter.

        Each skill should have a name and a number describing fighter level (0-5).

        Each fighter should have multiple skills (at least 3, but not more than 9).

        The skill level of a fighter never changes.
